# Cover Shuffle

A Playnite extension that lets you keep a small pool of alternate cover
artworks per game (up to 10) and rotate through them automatically, or on
demand — without a custom Playnite theme.

## Features

- **Per-game cover pool** — up to 10 covers per game, added from:
  - a local image file,
  - [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) (requires a free API key), or
  - artwork Playnite already has for the game (its cover, background, and icon) —
    works without any API key.
- **Randomized, no-immediate-repeat shuffling** — each shuffle draws from a
  randomized cycle of the game's enabled covers; every cover is shown once
  before the cycle reshuffles, and the first cover of a new cycle is never
  the same as the last cover of the old one (when more than one cover is
  available).
- **Safe artwork ownership** — the game's original cover is captured the first
  time Cover Shuffle takes control of a game, and can always be restored.
  Removing a cover from the pool never deletes the underlying file.
- **Scheduled shuffling** — each game has its own shuffle interval (or
  inherits the global default). A due shuffle is applied once when Playnite
  starts; Playnite being closed for a while never causes a pile-up of missed
  shuffles. A cover whose file has gone missing is skipped rather than
  applied, so a manually deleted file never leaves a broken cover behind.
- **Shuffle on game launch** — optionally rotate a game's cover the moment
  you launch it, per game or globally. Uses the same schedule as interval
  shuffling, so launching a game also resets its next scheduled shuffle
  rather than running on a second, separate clock.
- **New-game automation** — choose whether newly installed games are left
  alone, prompted about, or automatically prepared for Cover Shuffle.
  "Automatic" pulls in the game's existing Playnite cover art so it has
  something to shuffle right away, and never contacts SteamGridDB on its own.
- **Notifications** — optionally surface scheduled shuffle activity (success,
  or failure) as a Playnite notification. Configurable per game or globally:
  silent, errors only, or every shuffle.
- **Cover Shuffle Manager** — a searchable list of every game Cover Shuffle
  manages, with bulk enable/disable/interval actions and configuration
  import/export.
- **Maintenance** — scan for orphaned cover files, cover records whose file
  went missing, and cached provider images; nothing is deleted without an
  explicit, confirmed action.

## Installation

1. Download the `.pext` package (see [Development](#development) if you're
   building it yourself).
2. Double-click it with Playnite running — Playnite will prompt to install
   it — or use **Add-on menu → Extensions → Install from file** in Playnite.
3. Restart Playnite when prompted.

No configuration is required to start using local files or Playnite's own
artwork as covers. SteamGridDB is optional — see below.

**Upgrading:** installing a newer version over an existing one preserves all
saved configuration, covers, and shuffle state; nothing needs to be
reconfigured. Cover Shuffle's data lives entirely in its own storage folder
under Playnite's extension data directory, separate from Playnite's own
library data, so upgrading or reinstalling the plugin never touches your
games or their original artwork.

## Configuration

Open Playnite's **Add-on menu → Extensions → Cover Shuffle** (or find it in
Playnite's settings under Extensions) to set the defaults every game follows
unless it has its own override:

| Setting | What it controls |
|---|---|
| Enable Cover Shuffle | Default enabled state for newly-configured games |
| Avoid consecutive duplicate covers | Never repeat the currently-showing cover on a shuffle |
| Shuffle on Playnite startup | Apply a due shuffle once when Playnite starts |
| Shuffle on game launch | Also shuffle the cover the moment you launch a game |
| Shuffle interval (hours) | Default time between shuffles |
| New game behavior | Do nothing / Ask / Automatic — see [Usage](#usage) |
| Notifications | Silent / Errors only / Every shuffle |
| SteamGridDB API key | Optional — see below |

Any game can override its enabled state or interval individually from its
**Manage Covers** window without touching these global defaults. Each setting
is overridden independently: giving one game its own interval doesn't freeze
any of its other settings, so if you later change the global notification
preference (for example), that game keeps following it live unless you've
overridden that setting too. Click **Reset to Global Defaults** in a game's
Manage Covers window to clear all of its overrides and have it follow every
current global default again.

Settings are validated when you close the settings page — an interval under
one minute is rejected with an explanation rather than silently accepted or
crashing the plugin.

## SteamGridDB setup

SteamGridDB is entirely optional. Local files and Playnite's own artwork
work with no setup at all; only the **Add Cover → SteamGridDB** menu action
needs it.

1. Create a free account at [steamgriddb.com](https://www.steamgriddb.com/).
2. Generate an API key at
   [steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api](https://www.steamgriddb.com/profile/preferences/api).
3. Paste it into Cover Shuffle's settings → **API key**, then click
   **Validate** to confirm it's accepted before relying on it.

The key is never logged, never shown in an error message, and never stored
anywhere outside Playnite's own settings storage. If a search matches more
than one game (e.g. searching "Fallout"), you'll be asked which one you
meant before covers are shown — nothing is guessed silently.

## Usage

Right-click a game in Playnite → **Cover Shuffle**:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| Enable / Disable Cover Shuffle | Turns scheduled shuffling on/off for this game |
| Add Cover → Local File | Opens "Add Local Covers": drag & drop or browse for one or more images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, BMP, GIF), preview and remove candidates before importing, and see per-file status (duplicate, invalid, over the 20 MB size limit, or will be resized/converted). WEBP images are converted to PNG on import; images larger than 3000px on a side are scaled down automatically. Duplicate images (by content, not filename) are rejected automatically. |
| Add Cover → SteamGridDB | Search and browse SteamGridDB covers visually |
| Add Cover → Playnite Metadata | Pull in the game's existing cover/background/icon |
| Shuffle Now | Immediately advances to the next cover in the pool |
| Manage Covers | View covers, current status, and next shuffle time; choose a specific cover, or remove covers from the pool |
| Restore Original Cover | Puts the game's original cover back |

Inside **Manage Covers**, each cover card has a **Use This Cover** button to
jump directly to that cover instead of letting the randomized shuffle pick
one. This is a manual override: it still updates the game's cover, usage
stats, and next scheduled shuffle time, but it's recorded separately from a
normal "Shuffle Now" pick so the two don't get conflated.

The main Playnite menu has a **Cover Shuffle Manager...** entry for managing
many games at once: search, bulk enable/disable/interval, configuration
import/export, and maintenance (see below).

### New-game automation

Set in Cover Shuffle's settings under **New game behavior**:

- **Do nothing** — newly installed games are left alone.
- **Ask** — you're prompted whether to enable Cover Shuffle for it.
- **Automatic** — Cover Shuffle enables itself for the game and pulls in
  whatever cover art Playnite already has locally, so the game has
  something to shuffle right away. This never queries SteamGridDB on its
  own; that always requires you to explicitly use **Add Cover → SteamGridDB**.

A game is only ever treated as "new" once — reinstalling a game Cover
Shuffle has already seen (even one you later disabled) does not reapply
this behavior.

### Importing/exporting configuration

The Manager's **Export** button writes a `CoverShuffle.json` file plus the
referenced cover images into a folder you choose. **Import** reads that same
folder back in. This is meant for restoring your configuration on another
Playnite installation that shares the same library (e.g. a synced library on
a new PC) — Playnite's own game IDs need to match for the restored
configuration to line up with the right games.

### Maintenance

From the Cover Shuffle Manager, **Maintenance** scans for:

- cover files on disk no longer referenced by any cover record (orphans),
- cover records whose file is missing from disk, and
- cached SteamGridDB images.

The scan itself never changes anything; each cleanup action requires you to
review the findings and confirm it separately.

## Troubleshooting

**A game's cover isn't shuffling.**
Check its **Manage Covers** window: it shows whether Cover Shuffle is
enabled for that game, how many covers it has, and when the next shuffle is
due. A game needs at least one enabled cover and to be enabled itself.

**"This game has no covers configured yet."**
Add at least one cover via the game's **Add Cover** submenu before
shuffling — scheduled shuffles skip games with an empty pool rather than
failing loudly, but "Shuffle Now" will show you this message directly.

**"None of this game's covers could be found on disk."**
One or more cover files were deleted or moved outside the plugin (manually,
by another tool, antivirus quarantine, etc.). Open **Manage Covers** or run
**Maintenance** from the Cover Shuffle Manager to find and clean up the
affected records; the plugin never applies a reference to a file it can't
find, so you'll see this message instead of a broken cover image.

**"SteamGridDB API key is not configured." / "...rejected the configured
API key."**
Add or fix the key in Cover Shuffle's settings, then use the **Validate**
button to confirm SteamGridDB accepts it before searching again.

**"Could not reach SteamGridDB."**
A network problem (offline, DNS, firewall, SteamGridDB itself being down).
Everything that doesn't require SteamGridDB — local files, Playnite
metadata, shuffling already-added covers, enable/disable, restore — keeps
working normally while it's unreachable.

**A cover I added doesn't look right / the file seems corrupted.**
Cover Shuffle validates that a file is a real, decodable image before
adding it to the pool; an invalid file is rejected up front with a clear
message rather than being stored and failing later.

**The plugin's database file looks corrupted or Cover Shuffle lost its
configuration after a crash.**
Cover Shuffle never lets a corrupt data file crash the plugin. If its
database can't be parsed, the original file is preserved next to itself
(named with a `.corrupt-<timestamp>` suffix) for manual recovery, and the
plugin starts fresh rather than losing the ability to load at all.

**Something else looks wrong.**
Check Playnite's own extension log (`extensions.log` in the Playnite
folder) for lines starting with `PluginCoverShuffle#CoverShufflePlugin` —
Cover Shuffle logs warnings and errors there rather than showing raw
exceptions to you.

## Known limitations

- Outside of launching a game, a due shuffle is applied at Playnite startup
  only — a game left running for days past its interval, without being
  relaunched, shuffles at the next restart rather than mid-session.
- The startup shuffle only applies to installed games; an enabled game that
  isn't installed stays due and shuffles the next time Playnite starts after
  it's installed.
- The Playnite Metadata provider only picks up artwork already downloaded to
  a local file, not a bare remote URL some library plugins store instead.
- Configuration import/export is intended for the same Playnite library
  (matching game IDs); it does not remap covers to a different library.

## Development

- Target framework: `net462` (matches Playnite's own runtime).
- Build: `dotnet build PluginCoverShuffle.csproj` (also copies the DLL next
  to `extension.yaml`, where Playnite expects it, and to
  `bin/<Configuration>/`). `Playnite.SDK.dll` is deliberately excluded from
  the build output — Playnite provides it at runtime.
- Package a release: `dotnet build PluginCoverShuffle.csproj -c Release -t:PackageExtension`
  produces `bin/Package/CoverShuffle_<version>.pext` containing exactly
  `extension.yaml`, `PluginCoverShuffle.dll`, and `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` — no
  debug symbols, no Playnite SDK assembly, nothing from `Tests/`.
- Tests: `dotnet test Tests/PluginCoverShuffle.Tests.csproj` — all tests run
  against fakes; none require a live Playnite installation, network access,
  or a SteamGridDB API key.
- Versioning: bump `<Version>`/`<AssemblyVersion>`/`<FileVersion>` in
  `PluginCoverShuffle.csproj` and `Version` in `extension.yaml` together —
  they must always match.
- See `CLAUDE.md` for the engineering ruleset this project was built against.
